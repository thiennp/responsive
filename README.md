This plugin help us detect browser, device, screensize and breakpoint. All browser, device, screen information will be added to body tag as class.

Use SASS, simply use them instead of media query as it is simple to construct the file and easier to fix issue without make the fixing affect to other device or browser. It will help us to avoid loop of bug fixing.
